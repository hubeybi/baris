Hi, I'm Tony.

I'm an Australian living in Melbourne, Victoria and working as a Senior Developer at [Readify](https://readify.net).

This site was started as an outlet to share my thoughts and learnings about software development, technology, and other topics.

If you'd like to contact me, I can be reached on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tonyho_).

Thanks for visiting!
